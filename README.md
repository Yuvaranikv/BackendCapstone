## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Yuvaranikv/BackendCapstone.git
    cd BackendCapstone
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up the database:**
    Ensure you have MySQL installed and running. Create a database named `book_store`:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE book_store;
    ```

4. **Run the SQL scripts to create tables and insert sample data:**

    ```sql
    USE book_store;

    -- Create authors table
    CREATE TABLE authors (
        author_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        biography TEXT
    );

    -- Create genres table
    CREATE TABLE genres (
        genre_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        genre_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    );

    -- Create books table
    CREATE TABLE books (
        book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        author_id INT,
        genre_id INT,
        price DECIMAL(10,2),
        publication_date DATE,
        FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(author_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (genre_id) REFERENCES genres(genre_id)
    );
